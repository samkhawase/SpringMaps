# SpringMaps

Very basic Spring Boot App.

The app lets users add markers on the Map, store them in an in memory DB, and let them query the data.

## Getting Started

Here are the steps to get started with the project on your local machine:
1. Clone the git repositiory
2. Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start the localserver. It'll run on `localhost:8080`
3. Open the `Maps.html` file and add some markers.
4. Open the `Control_Panel.html` file and you'll see the data from the REST server. The colomns are sortable.
